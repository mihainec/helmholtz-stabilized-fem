# helmholtz-stabilized-fem
FEniCS implementation of the numerical method introduced in the following paper:
[1] E. Burman, M. Nechita and L. Oksanen, Unique continuation for the Helmholtz equation using stabilized finite element methods, J. Math. Pures Appl. (to appear), 2018.

Also contains some brief numerical experiments regarding the convergence of the method.
